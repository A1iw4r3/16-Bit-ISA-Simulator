# 16-Bit-ISA-Simulator
A simple 16-bit Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) simulator in C++.

# x86 Register Simulator

This simulator is designed to simulate simple register operations based on the x86 architecture. It includes basic arithmetic operations such as move, add, subtract, multiply, and divide.

The sample program demonstrates various capabilities of the ISA simulator, including moving values to registers, performing arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), and incrementing/decrementing register values. After executing the program, it will display the final values of the registers.
